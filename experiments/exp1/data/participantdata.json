If I had to navigate that obstacle I placed I higher value on it. If I didn't, I didn't think about the obstacle which means I gave it a low value.","103":"I wasn't aware there was an attention question actually.

","164":"I tried to remember what was said","165":"Yes!","166":"Based on a combination of visual and kinaesthetic memory","167":"I answered the attention questions carefully and attentively. The areas that connected me to the finish goal were generally where I focused my attention.","168":"I tried to answer the questions based on what my eyes focused on and how long this focus was.

Even if they were, I vaguely noticed them.","187":"By reading the directions","188":"quite well","189":"If I remembered my eyes looking at the object, it couldn't score lower than a 3. If an objectlied along the path I took and that increased it's score, if I ran into the object with the ball that increased it's score. If I didn't remember the object being there it got a one, generally objects that were not in the path I took scored lower than 4 unless I remembered being aware they blocked off access to the yellow square.","190":"I tried to remember the specific block that was highlighted and if I had thought about getting around it","191":"I answered according to what my eyes seemed to focus on the most and what I considered important when deciding which path to take.","192":"I answered them honestly","193":"","194":"I answered them with how much attention I gave each piece while I was playing the game and therefore how much it effected my route.","195":"I am not sure what you mean.

","200":"If it was in my path I tended to notice it more.","201":"I looked at the map shown with each set of questions and tried to remember if each highlighted obstacle actually existed during the tasks. I then chose the numbers based on how sure I was that it was actually present during the task (8 for absolutely certain and 1 for I couldn't remember it at all.
