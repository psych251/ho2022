<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I will replicate the results shown in Figure 3 of the paper <em>People construct simplified mental representations to plan</em> by Mark Ho et al.&nbsp;(2022).</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors propose task construal – a computational framework of planning that allows for constructing simplified task representations before planning, claiming that this capacity to control our mental representations better mirrors human behavior. Specifically, the authors derive a model of value-guided construal under the resource-rational perspective that an ideal, cognitively limited decision-maker should form value-guided construals that balance the complexity of a representation and its use for planning and acting. I am interested in understanding how we might construct and use flexible representations for mental simulation, so this work in the planning domain is highly relevant. In particular, their use of memory traces to probe whether an object was represented during planning is methodologically relevant to my work as I look for ways to explore the content of our mental representations in my research.</p>
<p>For this replication, I will recreate the initial experiment where the participants are first asked to navigate a maze composed of tetromino-shaped obstacles and then probed on their awareness of each obstacle after completing the navigation. Specifically, I will be reproducing the finding in Figure 3a, where they plot a histogram of the participants’ mean awareness of each obstacle, splitting on whether or not the value-guided construal model assigned less than or greater than 50% probability of including the obstacle in the construal.</p>
<p>Like the original authors, I will be using psiTurk and jsPsych (v.6.0.1) with Prolific. Rather than regenerating the scores from the computational models, I will use the same stimuli in the original paper. To generate the figures, I will directly compare the results with the model outputs from the original paper (i.e., I will not be recreating the model from scratch). The primary challenge will lie in recreating the behavioral experiment.</p>

<section id="power-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="power-analysis">Power Analysis</h3>
<p><del>Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size. Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.</del></p>
<p>For the primary analysis, the authors performed a <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test for independence between participants’ mean awareness responses of each obstacle in each maze and the model predictions. They reported <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2(1, N=84)=23.03\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = 1.6 \times 10^{-6}\)</span>, effect size <span class="math inline">\(w = 0.52\)</span>.</p>
<p>Due to constraints on funding, the large effect size of <span class="math inline">\(0.52\)</span>, and the specifics of this analysis, we believe that a sample of <span class="math inline">\(n=100\)</span> will suffice to detect the effect with sufficient confidence. This is because the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test is actually looking at a comparison of 84 obstacles across 12 mazes, where each of the 84 obstacles is given (1) a model likelihood prediction of whether or not participants will be aware of the obstacle, and (2) the average awareness rating (on an 8-point scale, normalized between 0 and 1) across all participants in the sample. So increasing the sample only increases our confidence in each obstacle’s awareness rating, however as shown in the pilot data these awareness ratings converge relatively quickly.</p>
</section>
<section id="planned-sample" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="planned-sample">Planned Sample</h3>
<p>In the original paper, the authors requested 200 participants on Prolific and wrote that a trial was excluded if any of the following occured during navigation:</p>
<ul>
<li>&gt;5,000 ms was spent at the initial state</li>
<li>&gt;2,000 ms was spent at any non-initial state</li>
<li>&gt;20,000 ms was spent on the entire trial</li>
<li>&gt;1,500 ms was spent in the last three steps</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants with &lt;80% of trials after exclusions or who failed 2 of 3 comprehension questions were excluded, which resulted in n = 161 participants’ data being analysed. The authors reported the following demographics: median age of 28; 81 male, 75 female, 5 neither</p>
<p>In our replication, we will recruit 100 participants due to the considerations aformentioned.</p>

<p>Materials relevant to the study can be found <a href="https://github.com/markkho/value-guided-construal/tree/main/experiments/exp1">here</a>. The preregistration is <a href="https://osf.io/mv3ux">here</a>.

<section id="procedure" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedure">Procedure</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Our initial experiment used a maze-navigation task in which the participants moved a circle from a starting location on a grid to a goal location using the arrow keys. The set of initial mazes consisted of twelve 11×11 mazes with seven blue tetronimo-shaped obstacles and centre walls arranged in a cross that blocked movement. On each trial, the participants were first shown a screen displaying only the centre walls. When they pressed the spacebar, the circle they controlled, the goal and the obstacles appeared, and they could begin moving immediately. Moreover, to ensure that the participants remained focused on moving, we placed a green square on the goal that shrank and would disappear after 1,000 ms but reset whenever an arrow key was pressed, except at the beginning of the trial when the green square took longer to shrink (5,000 ms). The participants received US$0.10 for reaching the goal without the green square disappearing (in addition to the base pay of US$0.98). The mazes were pseudorandomly rotated or flipped, so the start and end state was constantly changing, and the order of mazes was pseudorandomized. After completing each trial, the participants received awareness probes, which showed a static image of the maze they had just navigated, with one of the obstacles shown in light blue. The participants were asked “How aware of the highlighted obstacle were you at any point?” and could respond using an eight-point scale (which was rescaled to 0–1 for analyses). Probes were presented for the seven obstacles in a maze. None of the probes were associated with a bonus.</p>

<section id="analysis-plan" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis-plan">Analysis Plan</h3>
<p>I aim to follow the following analysis plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect data</li>
<li>Preprocessing and apply exclusion criteria using <a href="https://github.com/markkho/value-guided-construal/blob/main/experiments/exp1/prep_results.py">this python script</a></li>
<li>Generate <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test and figure 3a using <a href="https://github.com/markkho/value-guided-construal/blob/main/analyses/exp-1.ipynb">this jupyter notebook</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>key analysis of interest</strong> is the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test for independence. The authors first split the obstacles across mazes on the basis of whether the value-guided construal model assigned a probability of less than or equal to 0.5 or greater than 0.5. Then after also splitting on the basis of whether mean awareness responses were less than or equal to 0.5 or greater than 0.5, they used a <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test for independence and found that this awareness split was predicted by value-guided construal (<span class="math inline">\(\chi^2(1, N=84)=23.03\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = 1.6 \times 10^{-6}\)</span>, effect size <span class="math inline">\(w = 0.52\)</span>).</p>
<p>I also aim to reconstruct the plot from figure 3a, which is a histogram of participant mean awareness responses, splitting the data on whether value-guided construal assigned a probability of less than or equal to 0.5 or greater than 0.5.</p>

<p>Our primary result was a <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test for independence. Specifically, the authors split the set of 84 obstacles across mazes on the basis of whether the value-guided construal model assigned a probability of less than or equal to 0.5 or greater than 0.5. They then similarly split the obstacles on the basis of whether mean awareness responses were less than or equal to 0.5 or greater than 0.5, and with the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> test for independence found that this split was predicted by value-guided construal <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2(1, N=84)=23.02\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p = 1.6 \times 10^{-6}\)</span>, effect size <span class="math inline">\(w = 0.52\)</span>. Thus, we see that the result closely replicated the original paper, suggesting that people’s responses align well with how an ideal, cognitively limited decision-maker should form value-guided construals that balance the complexity of a representation and its use for planning and acting.</p>
